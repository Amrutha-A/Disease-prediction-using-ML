# Disease-prediction-using-ML
It is a machine-learning project which predicts human diseases by analyzing the symptoms encountered.
The models used for training are - Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
Validation of ML models is done with the K-fold validation technique.
The accuracy score of each model is visualized using a confusion matrix.
The final output is visualized using Tkinter.
