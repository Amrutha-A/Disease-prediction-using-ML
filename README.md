# Disease-prediction-using-ML
It is a machine learning project which predicts diseases analysing the symptoms encountered.
The models used for training are - Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, Random forest and Support Vector Machine.
Validition of ML models is done with K-fold validation technique.
Accuracy score of each model is visualised using confusion matrix.
